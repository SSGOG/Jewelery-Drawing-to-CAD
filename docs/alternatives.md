# Alternative Strategies Considered

## Deep Learning Approaches

We considered several neural network-based approaches:

1. **Image-to-CAD models**: 
   - Directly generate CAD models from images
   - Currently limited by available training data
   - Difficult to ensure manufacturability constraints

2. **Diffusion-based vectorization**:
   - Promising for style transfer and enhancement
   - Less precise for engineering applications

3. **Neural implicit surfaces**:
   - Excellent for organic shapes
   - Difficult to parameterize for precise manufacturing

## Other CV Techniques

1. **Classic edge detection (Canny, Sobel)**:
   - Good for general purpose edge detection
   - Lacks the precision needed for jewelry design

2. **Hough transforms**:
   - Excellent for finding geometric primitives
   - Limited for organic, free-form curves

3. **Active contours**:
   - Powerful for precise boundary detection
   - Computationally intensive and sensitive to initialization

## Decision Rationale

We chose our current approach because:
- It provides the right balance of precision and automation
- It generates manufacturable results by design
- It's transparent and debuggable compared to black-box ML approaches
- It can be extended with ML components in the future

# Technical Approach

## Pipeline Design

Our jewelry CAD pipeline follows a multi-stage process:

1. **Image Ingestion**: Support for various input formats including sketches and vector files
2. **Preprocessing**: Image enhancement, noise reduction, and binarization
3. **Contour Detection**: Precise identification of edges and curves
4. **Vectorization**: Conversion of raster contours to CAD-compatible vector curves
5. **3D Generation**: Extrusion of 2D profiles into 3D models
6. **Validation**: Ensuring manufacturability through mesh analysis

## Computer Vision Techniques

We use a combination of traditional CV and modern approaches:

- **Adaptive Thresholding**: For robust binarization of varying input qualities
- **Morphological Operations**: To clean up noise and connect broken edges
- **Contour Hierarchy**: To distinguish between outer boundaries and interior details
- **Spline Fitting**: For smooth, CAD-compatible curve representation

## Why This Approach

This hybrid approach was chosen because:
- It provides precise control over the vectorization process
- It ensures watertight meshes suitable for manufacturing
- It balances computational efficiency with accuracy
- It can be easily tuned for different jewelry types and styles

# Manufacturability Considerations

## Watertight Meshes

Our pipeline ensures watertight meshes through:

1. **Contour Validation**: All contours are checked for closure
2. **Mesh Repair**: Automatic fixing of non-manifold edges and holes
3. **Normal Consistency**: Uniform face orientation throughout the mesh

## Curve Fidelity

We maintain high curve fidelity by:

1. **Adaptive Sampling**: Denser points in high-curvature regions
2. **Spline Smoothing**: Reducing noise while preserving design intent
3. **Feature Preservation**: Maintaining sharp corners where appropriate

## Extrusion Parameters

We ensure proper extrusion for manufacturing:

1. **Minimum Thickness**: Validation of all wall thicknesses
2. **Support Considerations**: Avoiding extreme overhangs where possible
3. **Draft Angles**: Considering mold release requirements for casting

## Casting Considerations

The generated models are suitable for investment casting through:

1. **No Internal Cavities**: Ensuring the model is castable as a single piece
2. **Sprue Attachment Points**: Identifying suitable locations for sprues
3. **Uniform Wall Thickness**: Minimizing casting defects
